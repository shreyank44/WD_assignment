<h1> 
The Toyota Supra, a Japanese sports car that has left an indelible mark on automotive 
history, continues to captivate the hearts of enthusiasts even to this day. Originally introduced
as a mere trim level in 1978, it underwent several transformations over four generations before
emerging as its own distinct model. However, it was from 1993 to 2002 that the Supra truly 
solidified its legendary status, with the Supra Mk4 version standing out as a true marvel of 
engineering prowess. Offering a plethora of customizable options such as turbocharged
 engines, manual or automatic transmissions, and even a sports roof variant, the Supra became 
synonymous with personalized driving experiences.
